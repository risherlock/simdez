Simulation software for the satellite mission: Tamariw. The project is done with
Sriza as our Team Design Project.

### Todos

1. Create groundtrack widget.
2. Use multi-threading to plot groundstation and other visualization.
3. In mainwindow.cpp, relative paths are used. Use resources instead.

### Installation

1. Install the [open-source version](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss). I am not sure what exactly the problem is, but due to differences in licensing, I could not install Qt with my account and had to use Sriza's (thought I used same installer both times). I am using my university account, while Sriza has her private Gmail account. I had some license options ticked off, but her account simply said, *I am using Qt purely for personal purposes.*
